Adds a myriad of previously undocumented entities, as well as completely new or widely expanded descriptions, keyvalues, display changes, and icons for all of TF2's entities. Features some customization options as well as some other unique features. Based on work by A Spud Lord and others.

				<h2 id="Prefab Module">Prefab Module</h2>
				<hr>

				<ol>
					Features a large amount of ready-made prefabs to be used during alpha development of your map. Soundscapes, pickups, common gameplay and map elements, logic, lighting, and more. Some prefabs may have usage instructions inside the "comment" box in one of the entity windows. All misc prefabs lovingly stolen from Valve maps or recreated as generic versions.
					<br>
					Based on work by A Boojum Snark and various other contributors.

				<ol>
					<li><strong>Decompiled Valve Maps</strong>
						<br>
						Contains decompiled versions of all Valve-made and Valve-owned maps shipped in TF2, decompiled with the latest version of bspsrc. Note that the decompile process is inherently flawed since some information is lost when a map is compiled. You are unlikely to be able to immediately compile these maps and expect them to work perfectly. Things like areaportals and certain entities will likely be missing or set up wrong. All of these maps will require some work to be perfectly playable.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Source SDK 2013 VMFs</strong>
						<br>
						Contains Valve-published VMFs of certain TF2 maps, as found in the Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer. Note that these VMFs, while higher quality than the decompiled versions, may be slightly out of date.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Community Map VMFs</strong>
						<br>
						Select VMFs of community-owned maps shipped in TF2 whose creators volunteered to contribute to this pack.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Bonus: artpass_valvebase</strong>
						<br>
						The original whitebox released by Valve for the first TF2Maps Artpass Contest. This map eventually made it into the game in the form of Mountainlab and Mann Manor.

					<li><strong>Compile Config: BAMF TF2 Super Duper</strong>
						<br>
						Compiles a map “with all bells and whistles”. May take a while, depending on your computer. Features an additional VRAD step for HDR to evade memory issues.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Improved CompilePal Error Analysis</strong>
						<br>
						By default, CompilePal uses the error finder and analysis from Interlopers.net - which is passable, but has also not been maintained in a long time. This one adds more information and solutions and rephrases existing content to be more easily understandable.

					<li><strong>RadShadowMan</strong>
